What is this?
=============

    Add description.


Installing
==========

    Instructions for installing this software are in INSTALL.


Unit Tests
==========

    Unit tests can be easily run from ./unittests.py

    These tests are very important, because the whole project is going to be
    developed with TDD (Test Driven Development). All public functionality will
    be tested before they are created. This also provides the design quality
    with refactoring.


Documentation and Support
=========================

    Coming later.
